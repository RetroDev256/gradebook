# Java Gradebook

This java gradebook program is a program that adds, updates, and calculates the grade of a student, based on their assignment grades, for each course they are enrolled in. The project demonstrates conditionals, loops, functions, classes, data structures (like ArrayList), and demonstrates challenges such as class inheritance (abstract/extends).

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Install the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 19+)
2. Install build tools such as "make" and "clang-format"
3. Run `make` or `make run` in the target directory

Instructions for using the software:

1. Run `make run`
2. Using the REPL, insert student, teacher, course, assignment, grade, and enrollment information.
3. Using the REPL, request student gradebook data. The grades are calculated and displayed.

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Java compiler `javac`
* Java virtual machine `java`
* Jar packager `jar`
* make binary `make`
* clang-format binary `clang-format`

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* More robust parsing
* Mutable database
* Efficient data lookup
* Persistent data across program restarts
